I was using the Faker gem (http://faker.rubyforge.org/) to generate test data
for an application, but since the application is in spanish, the test data
looked weird.

So I created this small extension to address that.

Many of Faker's method have their mx_ prefixed counterpart in this extension.

I hope you find this as useful as I have.

To use:

gem install faker
gem install ivanvr-faker_es_mx --source=http://gems.github.com

require 'faker'
require 'faker_es_mx'
